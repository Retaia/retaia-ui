## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public GitHub issues for security reports.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting / GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.

When reporting a vulnerability, include:

- a clear description of the issue and its impact
- the affected page, API integration, dependency, workflow, or component
- exact reproduction steps or a proof of concept
- configuration or environment assumptions
- any suggested remediation if you already identified one

## Response Expectations

- We will acknowledge a valid report as quickly as possible.
- We will triage, reproduce, and assess severity before discussing remediation scope.
- We may ask for additional details if the report is incomplete or not reproducible.
- Fixes are typically prepared against the latest supported branch and may be disclosed after remediation is available.

## Scope Notes

This policy covers the contents of this repository, including:

- application UI/runtime code
- generated API client artifacts committed in this repository
- GitHub Actions workflows
- dependency update configuration such as Dependabot

Operational incidents outside this repository, third-party service outages, backend-only vulnerabilities in other repositories, and unsupported forks are out of scope for this policy.
